# UAV-based Tomato Leaf Size Estimation and Counting

## 

Automation of greenhouse monitoring and harvesting tasks using robots and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has gained attention in recent years. However, automated methods remain slow compared to manual (human) monitoring methods due to high complexity constraints imposed by the environment and the tasks at hand. We present an UAV based approach to monitor tomato plant growth from close ranges. We focus on precise leaf counting, as well as leaf area and curvature measurements. We combine fast UAVs and modern Structure from Motion (SfM) methods, such as Gaussian Splatting, to reveal complex plant morphologies on reasonable time scales and with sufficient measurement precision. We compare our results to traditional (manual) approaches, with only minor divergence.
